### What is PHPUnit?
The goal of unit testing is 
>`to isolate each part of the programme and show that the individual parts are correct`.

# What does `Assertions` mean?
Just asserting that something match the expected value or does something you wanted to do.

# Whats the flow of running `phpunit`?
1. Install the [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.readthedocs.io/en/9.2/installation.html)  
2. Configure the `phpunit.xml`  
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<phpunit bootstrap="vendor/autoload.php"
         colors="true"
         verbose="true"
         stopOnFailure="false">
     <testsuites>
         <testsuite name="unit">
             <directory>tests/unit</directory>
         </testsuite>
     </testsuites>
</phpunit>
```

3. Create `app`, `app/Models`and `tests/unit` folders  
4. Build codes bite by bite, and then run phpunit  
`./vendor/bin/phpunit`  

### File name and the class name must be the same!
For example, `UserTest.php`  
```php
<?php

use PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase;

class UserTest extends TestCase
{
    public function testThatWeCanGetTheFirstName()
        {
            //       
        }

}
```


### [`doc block`](https://phpunit.readthedocs.io/en/7.3/annotations.html)
As an alternative to prefixing your test method names with `test`, you can use the `@test` annotation in a methodâ€™s DocBlock to mark it as a test method.
```php
/**
 * @test
 */
public function initialBalanceShouldBe0()
{
    $this->assertSame(0, $this->ba->getBalance());
}
```
### What are the Assertion methods, [link](https://phpunit.de/manual/6.5/en/appendixes.assertions.html)
 
### Why need namespace? 
Namespaces are basically a way of organizing your PHP classes and preventing from any kind of code conflicts.
Namespaces allows us to use the same class names and differentiating them by their namespaces.

First Ninja class
```php
<?php 

namespace Dojo;

class Ninja
{

}
```

Second Ninja class
```php
<?php 

namespace Training;

class Ninja
{

}
```

To Include both Ninja classes
```php
<?php

// require both of our ninja classes
require "Dojo/Ninja.php";
require "Training/Ninja.php";

// create a new Ninja in the Dojo namespace
$ninja1 = new Dojo\Ninja();

// create a new Ninja in the Training namespace
$ninja2 = new Training\Ninja();
```

### What is Code Coverage Analysis?
>In computer science, code coverage is a measure used to describe the degree to which the source code of a program is tested by a particular test suite.  
>A program with high code coverage has been more thoroughly tested and has a lower chance of containing software bugs than a program with low code coverage.
