## Issue [#198](https://github.com/gigascience/gigadb-website/issues/198)
Found out that the commited changes cannot be seen in the local gigadb.  
- [rollbacked](https://www.shellhacks.com/git-revert-to-specific-commit-local-pushed/) to commit ID: 3954c0b0, and make two changes in help.html.dist and help.php.  
- still cannot see the changes in local gigadb website.
